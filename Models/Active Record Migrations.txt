Active Record Migrations

Migrations are a feature of Active Record that allows you to evolve your database schema over time. Rather than write schema modifications in pure SQL, migrations allow you to use an easy Ruby DSL to describe changes to your tables.

1. Migration Overview

Migrations are a convenient way to alter your database schema over time in a consistent and easy way. They use a Rudy DSL so that you don't have to write SQL by hand, allowing your schema and changes to be database independent.

You can think of each migration as being a new 'version' of the database. A schema starts off with nothing in it, and each migration modifies it to add or remove tables, columns, or entries. Active Record knows how to update your schema along this timeline, bringing it from whatever point it it in the history to the latest version. Active Record will also update your db/schema.re file to match the up-to-date structure of your database.
